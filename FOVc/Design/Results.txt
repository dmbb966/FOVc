OffDistAx vs OffDistCube (calculates the distance between two offset coordinate pairs converting to Axial or Cubic, respectively)
- WITH random number generation, OffDistAx takes 8.37s to run (10000^2 iterations) compared to 8.59s for OffDistCube (best case)
 - due to randomness, performance sometimes is equivalent.
- WITHOUT random number generation, OffDistAx takes 3.14s to run versus 3.39 seconds, about 8% faster

AzimuthAx vs AzimuthOff 
Using iterator:
6.39 seconds (AzimuthOff)
6.16 seconds (AzimuthAx) - about 5% faster
